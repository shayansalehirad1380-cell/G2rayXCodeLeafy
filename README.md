1. **Fork the Repo:** Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page to copy it to your account.
2. **Create Codespace:** Open your forked repository, click the green **Code** button, select the **Codespaces** tab, and then click **Create codespace on main**.
3. **Wait for Load:** Wait a few minutes for the environment to build.
4. **Launch Panel:** Once the terminal loads, the G2ray CLI panel will appear automatically!

## 🎮 Panel Controls

The G2ray Panel provides a full suite of tools:

- **Core Controls:** Generate configs, start/stop/restart the engine, and view QR codes.
- **Configuration:** Modify routing, change IPs, and tune the Keepalive frequency.
- **Analytics:** View real-time data usage, CPU/RAM usage of the engine, and check your Codespace quota/uptime.
- **Logs:** View the last 15 lines of the engine log to troubleshoot connectivity.

## 🛠️ How It Works

```
1. Panel initialized via Bash
   └─ Checks for existing config
      ├─ If missing: Runs setup/keygen
      └─ If present: Loads existing environment
2. Xray Engine execution
   └─ Configured with XHTTP protocol
   └─ API enabled for stats tracking
3. Keepalive mechanism
   └─ Background task prevents Codespace inactivity
   └─ Customizable interval (Normal/Aggressive/Economy)
```
